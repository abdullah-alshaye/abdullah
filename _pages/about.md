I am an assistant professor of Mechanical Engineering at [Kuwait University](http://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/ku/index.htm) and one of the co-founders of [Kuwait Institute for Training and Engineering Simulations (KITES)](http://kites-kw.com/en/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University *of* Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2016. Currently, I have [published](publications) more than *25 papers* in international recognized peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, and I have [taught](teaching) more than *8* undergraduate and graduate courses at Kuwait University. Prior of pursuing my higher education, I worked for couple of years in [Ministry *of* Electricity and Water](https://www.mew.gov.kw/en/) and [Kuwait Oil Company (KOC)](https://www.kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Default.aspx), and I have been awarded a green belt certification in Six sigma Methodologies from [Six Sigma Academy](https://www.ssaandco.com/) in 2011. I am interested in reading, swimming, and playing soccer.

My [research interests/areas](research) include:
- Biomechanics: Locomotion, Orthopedics.
- Applied Mechanics: Hybrid Methods for Stress Analysis (Thermoelastic Stress Analysis, Digital Image Correlation), Inverse Methods (Material Characterization).
- Vibration Control: Command Shaping, Multi-Mode Systems, Sloshing Suppression, Metamaterial.
