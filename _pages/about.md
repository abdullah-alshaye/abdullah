I am an assistant professor of Mechanical Engineering at [Kuwait University](http://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/ku/index.htm). I received my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Kuwait University](http://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/ku/index.htm) in 2009, Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2012, Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Engineering Mechanics in 2013, Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in Mathematics (Applied Mathematics) in 2015, and Ph.D degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University *of* Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).

My PhD thesis was in *experimental, analytical, and numerical analyses of orthotropic materials and biomechanics application*. I worked in couple of projects such as developing a mechanical device based on Timoshenko and Van Karmann idea to measure the kinetic friction coefficients, and validating of multiple musculoskeletal thumb models with collected experimental data. I am one of the Co-Founders of [Kuwait Institute for Training and Engineering Simulations (KITES)](http://kites-kw.com/en/) and currently in charge as the Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) and the lead simulation consultant. Prior pursuing my higher education, I worked in the [Kuwait Oil Company (KOC)](https://www.kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Default.aspx) for a couple of years as a surveillance engineer and in the [Ministry *of* Electricity and Water](https://www.mew.gov.kw/en/) as a power plant engineer. I am interested in reading, swimming, and playing soccer.

My [research interests](research) include: (i) biomechanics: locomotion, orthopedics; (ii) solid mechanics: experimental stress analysis (Thermoelastic Stress Analysis, Digital Image Correlation), inverse analysis (material characterization); and (iii) vibration control: command shaping, sloshing suppression. Currently, I have [published](publications) *21 papers* in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. I [taught](teaching) several courses in [University *of* Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) and [Kuwait University](http://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/ku/index.htm).
