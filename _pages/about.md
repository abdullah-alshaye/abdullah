I am an assistant professor of Mechanical Engineering at [Kuwait University](http://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/ku/index.htm). My research interests include: (i) biomechanics: locomotion, orthopedics; (ii) solid mechanics: experimental stress analysis (Thermoelastic Stress Analysis, Digital Image Correlation), inverse analysis (material characterization); and (iii) vibration control: command shaping, sloshing suppression.

I received my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Kuwait University](http://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/ku/index.htm) in 2009, Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2012, Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Engineering Mechanics in 2013, Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in Mathematics (Applied Mathematics) in 2015, and Ph.D degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University *of* Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My PhD thesis was in experimental, analytical, and numerical analyses of orthotropic materials and biomechanics application. I worked in couple of projects such as developing a mechanical device based on Timoshenko and Van Karmann idea to measure the kinetic friction coefficients, and validating of multiple musculoskeletal thumb models with collected experimental data.  currently an assistant professor in mechanical engineering at Kuwait University. I am one of the Co-Founders of [Kuwait Institute for Training and Engineering Simulations (KITES)](http://kites-kw.com/en/) and currently in charge as the Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) and the lead simulation consultant. Prior pursuing my higher education, I worked in the [Kuwait Oil Company (KOC)](https://www.kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Default.aspx) for a couple of years as a surveillance engineer and in the [Ministry *of* Electricity and Water](https://www.mew.gov.kw/en/) as a power plant engineer. I am interested in reading, swimming, and playing soccer.

Welcome! I am Abdullah data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).
