I am an assistant professor of Mechanical Engineering at [Kuwait University](http://kuweb.ku.edu.kw/ku/index.htm). I received my Ph.D degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University *of* Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2016. My PhD thesis was in *experimental, analytical, and numerical analyses of orthotropic materials and biomechanics application*. I worked in couple of projects such as developing a mechanical device based on Timoshenko and Van Karmann idea to measure the kinetic friction coefficients, and validating of multiple musculoskeletal thumb models with collected experimental data. I am interested in reading, swimming, and playing soccer.
